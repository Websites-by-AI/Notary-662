Here are the available modules:
- 'legal_drafter': Best for when the user wants to generate a specific legal document like a petition, contract, complaint, or legal letter. The user typically knows what kind of document they need.
- 'lawyer_finder': Use this when the user explicitly asks to find, search for, or get a list of lawyers, often specifying a specialty and/or location.
- 'notary_finder': Use this when the user asks to find a Notary Public office, often for official document certification or deeds.
- 'news_summarizer': Ideal for when the user asks for updates, summaries, or information about recent events, laws, or news topics. It uses Google Search to find current information.
- 'case_strategist': The best choice for broad, high-level goals that require multiple steps, like starting a business, planning a complex legal case, or creating a project. It breaks the goal down into a sequence of tasks.
- 'web_analyzer': Use this when the user provides a specific URL and wants to summarize, analyze, or extract information from that single page.
- 'document_analyzer': Best for when the user has an existing piece of text (like a contract or clause) and wants it reviewed, checked for errors, or improved.
- 'legal_training': Suitable when the user wants to learn about or get an explanation of a legal concept, law, or procedure.

**ریاست محترم دادگاه،**
با سلام و عرض ادب؛
احتراماً در خصوص پرونده کلاسه فوق، در مقام دفاع از موکل، [آقای/خانم ...], مراتب ذیل را در دو بخش دفاعیات شکلی و ماهوی به استحضار آن مقام عالی قضایی می‌رساند:

**بخش اول: دفاعیات شکلی**
[در صورت وجود ایرادات شکلی مانند عدم صلاحیت دادگاه، عدم اهلیت خواهان و... در این بخش ذکر شود. در غیر این صورت، این بخش حذف شود.]

**بخش دوم: دفاعیات ماهوی**
1. **شرح ماوقع از منظر موکل:**
   [خلاصه‌ای از وقایع را از دیدگاه موکل خود و بر اساس {description} برای ایجاد یک تصویر کلی در ذهن قاضی بیان کنید.]

2. **تحلیل و رد دلایل شاکی/خواهان:**
   [دلایل و مستندات طرف مقابل را یک به یک تحلیل و با استدلال حقوقی و با استناد به مدارک موجود در پرونده (مثلا صفحه ... پرونده) رد کنید.]

3. **ارائه دلایل و مستندات دفاعی:**
   **الف)** [اولین دلیل دفاعی ماهوی خود را به صورت مستدل مطرح کنید. مثلاً فقدان رابطه سببیت، عدم وجود سوء‌نیت، استناد به مدارک و ...]
   **ب)** [دومین دلیل دفاعی ماهوی خود را مطرح کرده و آن را با استناد به شهادت شهود، اسناد و ... تقویت نمایید.]
   **ج)** [در صورت لزوم، به مواد قانونی مرتبط (مثلا مواد ۱۹۰ و ۲۱۹ قانون مدنی یا اصل برائت در امور کیفری) استناد کرده و تفسیر حقوقی خود را ارائه دهید.]

**نتیجه‌گیری و تقاضا:**
با عنایت به جمیع جهات مذکور، از جمله [خلاصه مهمترین دلیل دفاعی]، و با توجه به [اصل برائت / عدم وجود دلیل کافی]، اتهام انتسابی به موکل یا ادعای مطروحه علیه ایشان فاقد وجاهت قانونی و شرعی است.
لذا از آن مقام محترم قضایی، تقاضای صدور رأی شایسته مبنی بر **[خواسته دقیق، مثلا: برائت کامل موکل / رد دعوای خواهان]** مورد استدعاست.

با سپاس و تجدید احترام
